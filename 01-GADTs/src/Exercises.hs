{- ONE -}

-- | Let's introduce a new class, 'Countable', and some instances to match.
class Countable a where count :: a -> Int
instance Countable Int  where count   = id
instance Countable [a]  where count   = length
instance Countable Bool where count x = if x then 1 else 0

-- | a. Build a GADT, 'CountableList', that can hold a list of 'Countable'
-- things.

data CountableList where
  CNil :: CountableList
  CCons :: Countable a => a -> CountableList -> CountableList
  -- ...


-- | b. Write a function that takes the sum of all members of a 'CountableList'
-- once they have been 'count'ed.

countList :: CountableList -> Int
countList CNil = 0
countList (CCons head tail) = (count head) + countList(tail)


-- | c. Write a function that removes all elements whose count is 0.

dropZero :: CountableList -> CountableList
dropZero CNil = CNil
dropZero (CCons head tail) | (count head) == 0 = dropZero tail
dropZero (CCons head tail) = CCons head (dropZero tail)


-- | d. Can we write a function that removes all the things in the list of type
-- 'Int'? If not, why not?

filterInts :: CountableList -> CountableList
filterInts = error "Contemplate me!"
-- no, because there is no type information



{- TWO -}

-- | a. Write a list that can take /any/ type, without any constraints.

data AnyList where
  ANil :: AnyList
  ACons :: a -> AnyList -> AnyList

-- | b. How many of the following functions can we implement for an 'AnyList'?

reverseAnyList :: AnyList -> AnyList
reverseAnyList xs = go xs id
  where
    go  ANil        f = f ANil
    go (ACons x xs) f = go xs (ACons x . f)

filterAnyList :: (a -> Bool) -> AnyList -> AnyList
filterAnyList = undefined
-- we can't since the list is not homogenus and we have no type information

lengthAnyList :: AnyList -> Int
lengthAnyList ANil = 0
lengthAnyList (ACons _ xs)  = 1 + lengthAnyList xs

foldAnyList :: Monoid m => AnyList -> m
foldAnyList = undefined
-- we can't since the list is not homogenus 

isEmptyAnyList :: AnyList -> Bool
isEmptyAnyList ANil = True
isEmptyAnyList _ = False

-- we can't we can't ensure the types have an Show instance
instance Show AnyList where
  show = error "What about me?"





{- THREE -}

-- | Consider the following GADT:

data TransformableTo output where
  TransformWith
    :: (input -> output)
    ->  input
    -> TransformableTo output

-- | ... and the following values of this GADT:

transformable1 :: TransformableTo String
transformable1 = TransformWith show 2.5

transformable2 :: TransformableTo String
transformable2 = TransformWith (uncurry (++)) ("Hello,", " world!")

-- | a. Which type variable is existential inside 'TransformableTo'? What is
-- the only thing we can do to it?
-- input, we can only transform to string

-- | b. Could we write an 'Eq' instance for 'TransformableTo'? What would we be
-- able to check?

instance Eq a => Eq (TransformableTo a) where
  (==) (TransformWith f x) (TransformWith g y) = (f x) == (g y)

-- | c. Could we write a 'Functor' instance for 'TransformableTo'? If so, write
-- it. If not, why not?

instance Functor TransformableTo where
  fmap g (TransformWith f x) = TransformWith (g . f) x





{- FOUR -}

-- | Here's another GADT:

data EqPair where
  EqPair :: Eq a => a -> a -> EqPair

-- | a. There's one (maybe two) useful function to write for 'EqPair'; what is
-- it?

areEqual :: EqPair -> Bool
areEqual (EqPair a b) = a == b

-- | b. How could we change the type so that @a@ is not existential? (Don't
-- overthink it!)

data EqPair' a where
  EqPair' :: Eq a => a -> a -> EqPair' a

-- | c. If we made the change that was suggested in (b), would we still need a
-- GADT? Or could we now represent our type as an ADT?



{- FIVE -}

-- | Perhaps a slightly less intuitive feature of GADTs is that we can set our
-- type parameters (in this case @a@) to different types depending on the
-- constructor.

data MysteryBox a where
  EmptyBox  ::                                MysteryBox ()
  IntBox    :: Int    -> MysteryBox ()     -> MysteryBox Int
  StringBox :: String -> MysteryBox Int    -> MysteryBox String
  BoolBox   :: Bool   -> MysteryBox String -> MysteryBox Bool

-- | When we pattern-match, the type-checker is clever enough to
-- restrict the branches we have to check to the ones that could produce
-- something of the given type.

getInt :: MysteryBox Int -> Int
getInt (IntBox int _) = int

-- | a. Implement the following function by returning a value directly from a
-- pattern-match:

getInt' :: MysteryBox String -> Int
-- getInt' _doSomeCleverPatternMatching = error "Return that value"
getInt' (StringBox _ x) = getInt x

-- | b. Write the following function. Again, don't overthink it!

countLayers :: MysteryBox a -> Int
countLayers EmptyBox = 0
countLayers (IntBox _ x) = 1 + countLayers x
countLayers (StringBox _ x) = 1 + countLayers x
countLayers (BoolBox _ x) = 1 + countLayers x

-- countLayers = error "Implement me"

-- | c. Try to implement a function that removes one layer of "Box". For
-- example, this should turn a BoolBox into a StringBox, and so on. What gets
-- in our way? What would its type be?

-- unwrapBox :: MysteryBox a -> MysteryBox b
-- unwrapBox EmptyBox = EmptyBox
-- unwrapBox (IntBox _ x) = x
-- unwrapBox (StringBox _ x) = x
-- unwrapBox (BoolBox _ x) = x




{- SIX -}

-- | We can even use our type parameters to keep track of the types inside an
-- 'HList'!  For example, this heterogeneous list contains no existentials:

data HList a where
  HNil  :: HList ()
  HCons :: head -> HList tail -> HList (head, tail)

exampleHList :: HList (String, (Int, (Bool, ())))
exampleHList = HCons "Tom" (HCons 25 (HCons True HNil))

-- | a. Write a 'head' function for this 'HList' type. This head function
-- should be /safe/: you can use the type signature to tell GHC that you won't
-- need to pattern-match on HNil, and therefore the return type shouldn't be
-- wrapped in a 'Maybe'!

hHead :: HList (a, b) -> a
hHead (HCons x _) = x

foo = hHead exampleHList

-- | b. Currently, the tuples are nested. Can you pattern-match on something of
-- type @HList (Int, String, Bool, ())@? Which constructor would work?

-- patternMatchMe :: HList (Int, String, Bool, ()) -> Int
-- patternMatchMe (HCons (x, (_, (_, ())))) = x

-- | c. Can you write a function that appends one 'HList' to the end of
-- another? What problems do you run into?




{- SEVEN -}

-- | Here are two data types that may help:

data Empty
data Branch left centre right

-- | a. Using these, and the outline for 'HList' above, build a heterogeneous
-- /tree/. None of the variables should be existential.

data HTree a where
  HEmpty
    :: HTree Empty

  HBranch
    :: HTree left -> centre -> HTree right
    -> HTree (Branch left centre right)

-- | b. Implement a function that deletes the left subtree. The type should be
-- strong enough that GHC will do most of the work for you. Once you have it,
-- try breaking the implementation - does it type-check? If not, why not?
deleteLeftTree :: HTree (Branch l c r) -> HTree (Branch Empty c r)
deleteLeftTree (HBranch _ c r) = HBranch HEmpty c r

deleteLeft
  :: HTree (Branch left centre right)
  -> HTree (Branch Empty centre right)

deleteLeft (HBranch _ centre right)
  = HBranch HEmpty centre right

-- | c. Implement 'Eq' for 'HTree's. Note that you might have to write more
-- than one to cover all possible HTrees. You might also need an extension or
-- two, so look out for something... flexible... in the error messages!
-- Recursion is your friend here - you shouldn't need to add a constraint to
-- the GADT!





{- EIGHT -}

-- | a. Implement the following GADT such that values of this type are lists of
-- values alternating between the two types. For example:
--
-- @
--   f :: AlternatingList Bool Int
--   f = ACons True (ACons 1 (ACons False (ACons 2 ANil)))
-- @

data AlternatingList a b where
  -- ...

-- | b. Implement the following functions.

getFirsts :: AlternatingList a b -> [a]
getFirsts = error "Implement me!"

getSeconds :: AlternatingList a b -> [b]
getSeconds = error "Implement me, too!"

-- | c. One more for luck: write this one using the above two functions, and
-- then write it such that it only does a single pass over the list.

foldValues :: (Monoid a, Monoid b) => AlternatingList a b -> (a, b)
foldValues = error "Implement me, three!"





{- NINE -}

-- | Here's the "classic" example of a GADT, in which we build a simple
-- expression language. Note that we use the type parameter to make sure that
-- our expression is well-formed.

data Expr a where
  Equals    :: Expr Int  -> Expr Int            -> Expr Bool
  Add       :: Expr Int  -> Expr Int            -> Expr Int
  If        :: Expr Bool -> Expr a   -> Expr a  -> Expr a
  IntValue  :: Int                              -> Expr Int
  BoolValue :: Bool                             -> Expr Bool

-- | a. Implement the following function and marvel at the typechecker:

eval :: Expr a -> a
eval = error "Implement me"

-- | b. Here's an "untyped" expression language. Implement a parser from this
-- into our well-typed language. Note that (until we cover higher-rank
-- polymorphism) we have to fix the return type. Why do you think this is?

data DirtyExpr
  = DirtyEquals    DirtyExpr DirtyExpr
  | DirtyAdd       DirtyExpr DirtyExpr
  | DirtyIf        DirtyExpr DirtyExpr DirtyExpr
  | DirtyIntValue  Int
  | DirtyBoolValue Bool

parse :: DirtyExpr -> Maybe (Expr Int)
parse = error "Implement me"

-- | c. Can we add functions to our 'Expr' language? If not, why not? What
-- other constructs would we need to add? Could we still avoid 'Maybe' in the
-- 'eval' function?





{- TEN -}

-- | Back in the glory days when I wrote JavaScript, I could make a composition
-- list like @pipe([f, g, h, i, j])@, and it would pass a value from the left
-- side of the list to the right. In Haskell, I can't do that, because the
-- functions all have to have the same type :(

-- | a. Fix that for me - write a list that allows me to hold any functions as
-- long as the input of one lines up with the output of the next.

data TypeAlignedList a b where
  -- ...

-- | b. Which types are existential?

-- | c. Write a function to append type-aligned lists. This is almost certainly
-- not as difficult as you'd initially think.

composeTALs :: TypeAlignedList b c -> TypeAlignedList a b -> TypeAlignedList a c
composeTALs = error "Implement me, and then celebrate!"
